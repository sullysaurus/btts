                Back to the Start is a tribute to Coldplay's earliest and most iconic era, capturing the raw emotion and atmospheric
                beauty of <em>Parachutes</em>, <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em>, and <em>X&Y</em>. With a deep reverence for the original sound, the band
                delivers an immersive experience that takes audiences on a journey through Coldplay's golden years—from the intimate
                melancholy of <strong>"Sparks"</strong> to the soaring anthems like <strong>"Clocks"</strong> and <strong>"Fix You."</strong>

                Led by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Scott Ivey, the band features Eric Johnson on guitar, Daniel Ellis on bass, and
                Brandon Barnes on drums. Together, they channel the spirit, tone, and passion that made Coldplay a global
                phenomenon—before the stadium synths and pop beats.
